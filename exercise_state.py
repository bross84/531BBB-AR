exercise_state.py — Pure: a movement's current e1RM, worked out from its last session in Hevy.
No DB access, no HTTP calls, no side effects.

Input is Hevy's per-set exercise history (one entry per set, every session, newest first):
    {workout_id, workout_title, workout_start_time, set_type, weight_kg, reps, rpe, ...}
The e1RM of a set follows the user's spreadsheet: weight in lb / RPE-table percentage for (reps, RPE),
with the weight in the lb the user typed (Hevy stores it as kg, so it is converted back and snapped to
the nearest half pound).
